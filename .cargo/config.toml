# Cross-compilation settings for ARM targets
# 
# IMPORTANT: When cross-compiling for ARM targets, the ring crate requires
# the __ARM_ARCH macro to be defined. This must be set as an environment 
# variable BEFORE the build starts. Set these in your CI/shell:
#
# For aarch64 (ARM64):
#   export CFLAGS_aarch64_unknown_linux_gnu="-D__ARM_ARCH=8"
#   export CFLAGS_aarch64_unknown_linux_musl="-D__ARM_ARCH=8"
#
# For armv7:
#   export CFLAGS_armv7_unknown_linux_gnueabihf="-D__ARM_ARCH=7"
#   export CFLAGS_armv7_unknown_linux_musleabihf="-D__ARM_ARCH=7"
#
# In GitHub Actions workflow, add these to the env section of the maturin-action step.

# The [env] section sets environment variables during cargo builds.
# These CFLAGS_* variables define __ARM_ARCH for the cc crate used by ring.
